# Add Popovers To Your Flask App

On Twitter, you often see that when you hover your mouse over a user's username, the person's profile is displayed in a tiny popover. This is true for Facebook and LinkedIn as well. In this tutorial, we will learn how to add popovers to our Flask app.

* Flask-Login for user authentication

## Create a Simple Application

I have already created a simple application that we will further build on. You can follow through by checking the [start a flask server](start_flask_server.md) tutorial.
