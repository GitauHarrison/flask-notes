In this chapter, I will show you how you can create a profile for every user who decides to leave a comment or a question in our blog. We will keep it very simple. Whenever a user posts a commment, we want the post to look something like this:

![User Comment](/images/user_comment.png)

Things you can see from this comment:
* Avatar
* Time a comment was posted
* The comment itself

Our blog is set to English, as a default language. But say a visitor of our site decides to post a comment in a non-English language, like Swahili, our blog should allow this comment, and additionally, provide live language translation.

With a non-English comment, a translate link is provided. Another visitor can click on the translate link to know what that comment means.
