# Enable Time-based Two-factor Authentication in Flask

One of the most effective ways to reduce online identity theft of online accounts is to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on an account. It adds a layer of security to the authentication process by making it harder for attackers to gain access to a person's devices or online accounts because, even if the victim's password is hacked, a password alone is not enough to pass the authentication check.

## Overview

Many applications allow their users to optionally enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on their accounts. They sign up and once logged in, they are free to enable or disable 2FA at any time. However, there may be some cases where it is necessary to make 2FA mandatory. For example, in the banking industry, if a user's account is used to send money to another user, it is necessary to make sure that the user has access to a time-based one-time token before they can send money. 

One-time passwords are used to generate a one-time token that is used to authenticate a user in a single login session. The tokens are generated by an authenticator app whose algorithm compares the resulting token to a known token. The algorithm is called [Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm). Most TOTP are proprietary and are not available for public use, but some are.


## Project Requirements


1. A smartphone 
2. Access to Google Playstore or App Store


## What We Will Do


1. [Install an authenticator app of choice](#install-an-authenticator-app-of-choice)
2. [Create a simple password-based flask application](#create-a-simple-password-based-flask-application)
3. [Integrate TOTP into the application](#integrate-totp-into-the-application)

The completed project is publicly available and application files are on [GitHub](https://github.com/GitauHarrison/how-to-implement-time-based-two-factor-auth-in-flask). You can refer to the repo as you build your own. If you would like to test the live application, here is the [link](https://simple-2fa.herokuapp.com/).


## Install an authenticator app of choice


Search for either of these two TOTP apps to begin:

* [FreeOTP Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.fedorahosted.freeotp&hl=en)
* [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en)

You are not limited to these two. You can use any other if you like. Why these apps? We will need them to scan the application's QR Code when we try to register a new user. The apps will consistently generate 30-second long one-time passwords for us.

## Create a simple password-based flask application


The focus of this tutorial is how to integrate a time-based one-time password into a flask application. The assumption here is that you already have one or more flask applications that you want to use to authenticate users. I will not go into the details of how to create a flask application. If you don't have one already, consider including:

- User registration and login mechanisms
    - You will need both registration and login webforms
    - You will need a database to store a user's information
    - You will need to authenticate users using a password
    - You will need a way to handle user sessions

To make the project a bit more complete, I have added features such as _password resets_ and _email verification_, though they have nothing to do with time-based one-time passwords.


### General Rules About Passwords


1. Never store a password in the database; rather, store its hash
2. Always use secure `HTTP` to transmit passwords
3. Compare a user's password against its hash in the database when authenticating a user



## Integrate TOTP into the application


As mentioned earlier, this application will have two-factor authentication mandatory. A simple workflow of creating a new user, logging in, and then enabling two-factor authentication is described below.

>A user registers for an account. The user is then prompted to scan the QR code generated by the application using an authenticator app. A new token form is shown after scanning the QR code where the user needs to key in the token seen in their authenticator app. If successful, the user is logged in.


### Integration table of contents

2. [Display a QR code for the user to scan](#display-a-qr-code-for-the-user-to-scan)
3. [Log the user in](#log-the-user-in)


Several packages implement TOTP algorithms. A simple search on [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=totp&submit=search) will reveal them. In this tutorial, I will use [`onetimepass`](https://github.com/tadeck/onetimepass/) because it is the most popular.

### Update the User model

A basic `User` model contains only the `password_hash` field to store a user's password. The application will need us to add another field called `totp_secret` to store the user's TOTP secret. Every time a user logs into their account, they will need to key in the token seen in the authenticator app. This token will be saved in the `totp_secret` field.


`app/routes.py`: Add totp field

```python
import os
import base64
import onetimepass as otp
# ...

class User(UserMixin, db.Model):
    # ...
    totp_secret = db.String(length=16)

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(User, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        if self.totp_secret is None:
            self.otp_secret = base64.b32encode(os.urandom(10)).decode('utf-8')

    def get_totp_uri(self):
        return f'otpauth://totp/TOTPDemo:{self.username}?secret={self.totp_secret}&issuer=TOTPDemo'

    def verify_totp(self, token):
        return otp.valid_totp(token, self.totp_secret)
```


The `otp_secret` is encoded as a [base32](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32) string, which makes it a printable string with 16 characters. It will be added to the database if it is not already there.

The `get_totp_uri()` function returns an authentication URI whose secret token is shared with the smartphone. The URI is rendered as a QRCode which a user will need to scan with his phone. This is what that URI looks like:

```python
otpauth://<protocol>/<service-name>:<user-account>?secret=<shared-secret>&issuer=<service-name>
```

* `<protocol>`: can be `totp`
* `<service-name>`: is the name of the service or application that  a user is authenticating to
* `<user-account>`: anything that identifies the user account. It can be the user's id, username, or email address

* `<shared-secret>`: the code used to seed the token generator algorithm
* `<issuer>`: normally set to the service name

The `verify_totp()` function takes a token as input and validates using the support provided by the onetimepass package.

Since we have updated the database schema, we need to generate a new migration script and apply the changes. Run the commands below in their order:

```python
(venv)$ flask db migrate -m 'add totp field'
(venv)$ flask db upgrade
```

### Display a QR code for the user to scan


When a user registers for an account, we will redirect them to a page where they can scan the QR code generated by the application. The user's username will be stored in a flask session so that the QR page knows what user is registering. 


`app/routes.py`: Redirect the user to the QR page


```python
@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def register():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = form.username.data
        user.set_password(form.password.data)
        db.session.add(user)
        db.session.commit()
        flash('You are now registered.')
        session['username'] = username
        return redirect(url_for('qr'))
    return render_template('register.html')
```

With the user now known, we can display the QR code page.

`app/routes.py`: Display QR Code page

```python
@app.route('/qr')
def qr():
    if 'username' not in session:
        return redirect(url_for('register'))
    username = session['username']
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
    if user is None:
        return redirect(url_for('register'))
    return render_template('qr.html'), 200, {
        'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate',
        'Pragma': 'no-cache',
        'Expires': '0'}
```

The view function makes certain that the QR Code is not cached by the browser. `qr.html` is used to display the QR Code as an image.


`app/templates/qr.html`: Display QR Code

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block app_content %}
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h1>Scan the QR Code Below</h1>
        <p>
            <img id="qr-code" src="{{ url_for('qr_code') }}" alt="QR Code" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Once scanned, you can <a class="btn" href="{{ url_for('login') }}">Login</a>
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
{%% endblock %}
```

The QR Code image is sourced from the view function `qr_code`. Each time a user registers, the QR code will be unique to him. 

`app/routes.py`: Generate QR code

```python
from flask import abort
from io import BytesIO
import pyqrcode


@app.route('/qr_code')
def qr_code():
    if 'username' not in session:
        return redirect(url_for('register'))
    username = session['username']
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
    if user is None:
        abort(404)
    
    del session['username']

    url = pyqrcode.create(user.get_totp_uri())
    stream = BytesIO()
    url.svg(stream, scale=5)
    return stream.getvalue(), 200, {
        'Content-Type': 'image/svg+xml',
        'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate',
        'Pragma': 'no-cache',
        'Expires': '0'}
```

If a user is not found registered, the application will tell the browser that the QR code image was not found or does not exist. On the other hand, if the user is registered, we begin by removing the username from the session. This is done so that the QR code is not displayed to the user again. The user's account will no longer be accessible. 

![QRCode](/images/2fa_flask/qrcode.png)

The URL generates the data that most TOTP apps expect. `pyqrcode` functions are invoked to generate the QR code as an SVG image. The data is saved in memory as a buffer, and the buffer is returned as the response whose content type is set to `image/svg+xml`.


### Log the user in


In the login form, we would like to not only provide the username and password fields, but we will also include a new token field. This token field will be used to validate the user's credentials.



`forms.py`: Token field in the Login page

```python
class LoginForm(FlaskForm):
    username = StringField('Username', validators=[DataRequired()])
    password = PasswordField('Password', validators=[DataRequired()])
    token = StringField('Token', validators=[DataRequired()])
    remember_me = BooleanField('Remember Me')
    submit = SubmitField('Login')
```

The rendering of the login page will have an additional check for tokens.

`routes.py`: Token authentication

```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    # ...
    form = LoginForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        user = User.query.filter_by(username=form.username.data).first()
        if user is None or not user.check_password(form.password.data) or \
                not user.verify_totp(form.token.data):
            flash('You have entered an invalid username, password or token.')
            return redirect(url_for('login'))

        # log user in
        # ...
    return render_template('login.html', form=form)
```

The login attempt is set to fail in three possible scenarios:

* The user is not found in the database
* The user's password is incorrect
* The user's token is incorrect

That's it! Mandatory two-factor authentication is now complete.
