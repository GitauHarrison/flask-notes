# Database Management Tools

These are software applications that help users to manage SQL server infrastructure. They allow users to configure, monitor, manage and administer SQL servers and databases. As a web developer or as a database administrator, you will be dealing with SQL statements to explore the database for various reasons:

- Querying the database
- Build and execute SQL code
- Generating reports
- Making a backup
- Diagonising an application for database-related problems

It is therefore important to choose and have the right tool that can speed up database-related tasks and make you more productive. There are many tools available in the market that can be used to work with a database. To name two, we have [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) and [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io). I will use DBeaver throughout the subsquent articles as we strive to understand SQL in-depth.

There are the two ways you can connect to PostreSQL:

1. [Using `psql`](databases/access_postgresql/psql.md)
2. [Using SQL client software application and database administration tool](databases/access_postgresql/dbeaver.md) (this article)

For reference, these are the topics we will cover in the entire database tutorial:

- [PostgreSQL Overview](postgresql.md) (this article)
- [Install PostgreSQL](install_postgresql.md)
- [Getting Started with PostgreSQL](getting_started_with_postgresql.md)
