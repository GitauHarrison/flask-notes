# Install PostgreSQL and DBeaver

Now that you have a brief understanding of what a database is, you know the history of PostgreSQL, and are familiar with some of the advantages of using PostgreSQL, you are ready to start using it. We will begin by learning how to install it in our operating system. We will also be using the DBeaver client software to help us get off the ground quickly.

For reference, these are the topics we will cover in this tutorial:

## Install PostgreSQL in Linux

### Approach 1

Most Linux distributions such as Debian and Ubuntu have PostgreSQL integrated with their package environments. It is recommended that you install PostgreSQL this way since it ensures a proper integration with the operating system, including automatic patching and other management functionality.

If you would like to experiment with installation and build from source, then you can do so by visiting the [Linux downloads (Ubuntu)](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/) for more information.
