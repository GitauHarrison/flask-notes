# Create A Flask App Using PostgreSQL Database

You have now decided to use the postgresql database to manage you data. Given all the features that come with it, as discussed in [Postgres Overview](00_postgresql_overview), you may be ready to start using it. Throughout this tutorial, I will show you how to create a password-based user authentication system that utilized the postgresql database.

If you are new to postgresql, I recommend that you start from these tutorials, in their order:

1. [Postgres Overview](databases/00_postgresql_overview)
2. [Install Postgres](databases/01_install_postgresql.md)
3. [Access PostgreSQL using `psql`](databases/access_postgresql/psql.md)
4. [Access PostgreSQL Using DBeaver](databases/access_postgresql/dbeaver.md)
5. [How to Secure PostgreSQL](databases/02_how_to_secure_postgresql.md)
6. [Getting Started With PostgreSQL](databases/03_getting_started_with_postgresql.md)


## Project Overview

The project we will create features a login page and registration page that allows users to create an account before accessing their profiles. We won't make the application more robust by adding extra features because the goal is to learn how to use postgreSQL database ONLY.
