# Testing APIs Using PostMan

Given the scope of our simple chat application, we have built all endpoints we wanted to have for both a web client specifically and also for any other client using APIs. During the development of our API, we have been testing each endpoint on our terminal to ensure that it works as intended. One tool that can help us test our endpoint is [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster.

For your reference, these are the topics in our discussion:

## Getting Started With Postman

Postman offers both the web client and the desktop app. You can choose to use either or both. If you would like to use the desktop app, you can download a version suitable for your operating system. As of this writing, there are desktop apps for Windows, Mac and Linux. I am using Ubuntu, so I will download one for [Linux](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

Postman requires us to [signup for free](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup). Follow the prompts to get started. You will eventually be redirected to your default personal workspace. 

![Postman workspace](/images/apis_in_flask/postman_workspace.png)

Postman workspaces enables you to organize and work together on API projects with your team. Within each workspace, you can share [APIs](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/creating-an-api/), [collections](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/first-steps/creating-the-first-collection/), [environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/) and other Postman elements. ou can create more workspaces for your personal use and to work with teammates. 

## Create A Collection

The essence of using a collection is to group related Postman requests in an effort to keep our workspace organized. We are going to test the endpoints of our chat application. It, therefore, makes sense to group all the requests we will be testing into a collection. All requests made in Postman will typically show up under your History tab on the left sidebar of your application.

First, let us begin by creating a workspace.

![Create collection](/images/apis_in_flask/create_collection.png)

Give the collection a relevant name then press "Enter".

## Working With Variables

Variables enables us to store and reuse values in Postman. By storing a value in a variable, we can reference it throughout our collections, environments and requests, thereby helping us work more efficiently. They are a key-value pair where each variable name represents its key.

For example, we know that our base URL is `http://localhost:5000/api`. Instead of having to type this in each request everytime we are testing an endpoint, we can create a variable such as `base_url` and assign it the value `http://localhost:5000/api`. We can then reference it using `{{base_url}}`. Should the base URL change in the course of our development, we only need to go to one place, that is the variable `{{base_url}}`, update our value and it will be applied acrose all collections and requests using it.

### Variable Scopes

Postman has different scopes, ranging from the broadest to the narrowest. Scopes allow us to tailor our processing to a variety of taskd ranging from development, testing and collaboration.

- **Global variables**: they are accessible throughout a workspace.
- **Collection variables**: they are available throughout the requests in a collection and are independent of environments (they do not change based on environemnt).
- **Environment variables**: they can be used in local development or testing or production, allowing you to specify [role-based access level](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/#working-with-environments-as-a-team).

There is also **data variables** and **local variables**. If a variable with the same name is declared in two different scopes, the value stored in the variable with narrowest scope will be used. For example, if there is a global variable named username and a local variable named username, the local value will be used when the request runs.


### Initial And Current Values

An **initial value** is a value sent in the element where the variable is defined. This value is synced to Postman servers and is shared with a team when the element is shared (useful during collaboration).

**Current value** is used when sending a request. These are local values that are not synced to Postman's servers. If changed, the current value won't be persisted in the original shared collection etc.


### Variable Types

- **Default type** is shown as plain text and does not have extra properties
- **Secret type** makes the initial and current values for all workspace members and is typically used to prevent the unintential disclosure of sensitive data, including API secrets, passwords, tokens and keys.


### Create Variables

Let us begin by creating our collection's variables. 

![Acess collecton variables](/images/apis_in_flask/access_collection_variables.png)

Let us begin by creating our first variable `base_url`.

![Base url variable](/images/apis_in_flask/base_url_variable.png)

Remember to save your changes by pressing "Ctrl + S". This variable, and others we will create, shall all be collection variables.


## Testing Endpoints

Now, we can start testing our endpoints. To begin, we need to add a request.

![Name collection](/images/apis_in_flask/add_request.png)


### Create A New User Request

The first request we are going to make is one that creates a new user. We have a view function called `api.create_user()` of the endpoint _/users_ that makes POST requests specifically designed to allow for the creation of new users. This is the only endpoint that can be accessed anonymously. As we noted [here](/api_flask/04_unique_resource_identifiers.md#register-a-new-user), we need a user's `username`, `email`, and `password` as arguments in order to make a successful request and return a **201 Created** response. An `about_me` argument is optional.

![Create new user request](/images/apis_in_flask/create_new_user_request.png)

I selected the POST method from the dropdown menu, manually keyed in the base URL variable as `{{base_url}}` and added the request parameters as seen in the table above. Before we can test the endpoint, we will need to specify in our header that the type of content we want is JSON. 

![Content type header](/images/apis_in_flask/content_type_header.png)

Then, click on the "Body" tab and check the "raw" radio button. On the dropdown menu that appears on the far right, select "JSON".

![Raw json](/images/apis_in_flask/raw_json.png)

Finally, let's update the body of the JSON with the key-value pairs of our collection variables.

![Create user through endpoint](/images/apis_in_flask/create_user_through_endpoint.png)

You will notice that a new entity has been created for you. Postman provides us with a pretty printed output of the 201 Created response.


### Generating Tokens

If you recall in our earlier lesson on [api authentication](/api_flask/05_api_authentication.md), we added token authentication to almost all our endpoints to protect against unauthorized access. The first step after our new user **njeri** has been created is to generate an expirable token for her. This token will be used to authenticate and authorize her to perform certain actions.


Because we are going to interact with the user **njeri** a lot, we can decide to create some variables used to indentify her. For example, two variables that we are going to use often after each token has expired is `username` and `password`.

![Add variables](/images/apis_in_flask/add_variables.png)

I have also added the `token` variable because we will need to use it whenever we want to access all other endpoints as the user **njeri**. At this point, it is empty, but we will be updating it shortly (Remember to save your work).



The mechanism we chose to generate a token was **basic authentication (BA)**. This mechanism requires that we provide a user's `username` and `password` as a key-value pair in a POST request. The POST request used to generate a token is _api/tokens_. On the terminal while using the HTTPie package, we run the following command:

```python
(venv)$ http --auth muthoni:muthoni123 http://localhost:5000/api/tokens
```

The request will be sent with the header `Authorization: Basic <username:password>`. In Postman, this can be achieved by selecting the Authorization type as "Basic Auth", then supply a user's `username` and `password` in the POST request.

![Basic auth header](/images/apis_in_flask/basic_auth_header.png)

Once done, press "Send" to generate her token.

![Sample token response](/images/apis_in_flask/sample_token_response.png)

With the token in place, we need to update our `token` variable by giving it the key seen in the response.

![Update token value](/images/apis_in_flask/update_token_value.png)


### Access Protected Endpoints

The first endpoint we would like to test is that used to retrieve the list of all users in the backend. The endpoint _api/users_ expects a user's token in order to view this list. Let us use **njeri**'s token to view the list of all users in the application.

![Token header](/images/apis_in_flask/token_header.png)

All endpoints are protected using the token-based mechanism, which requires that the authorization header be `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Ensure you select the type of authorization as "Bearer Token". Then update the value of the token using the `token` collection variable we created earlier.

![Add header token](/images/apis_in_flask/add_header_token.png)

Press "Send" to generate a list of all users in the backend (should the token be expired, remember to generate another one and update your variable accordingly).

![Users list](/images/apis_in_flask/users_list.png)

At this stage, I hope you now get the idea of how you can test your application's endpoints using Postman. I am not going to show you how to test the remaining endpoints. It is left to the reader to complete the testing of the remaining endpoints.
